So when discribing the methods, resources and thought processes used I'll probably be using a different context and meaning than others so here's the the explainations. Methods are anything that the Learn.co has provided it can range from the lessons themselves to the coding environment from the LearnIDE. Resources are outside links that usually are documentation but can also be code snippets that in some cases might provide the answer. Concerning the thought process is how I approach universally every learn.co lab and links into weather I'll be focusing more on methods are resources. So I hope this might prove useful to some and if not, then it'll hopefully prove useful to myself in the future. 

### List of methods that have been helpful
01. Asking a technical coach for help
02. Using require 'pry' and binding 'pry' to see state of program at different points
03. Taking notes of previous lessons subjects(to search how to do things in code)
04. Writing psuedo code(Usually based on spec description)
05. Opening the .spec file to lab(Useful for getting to know which ruby class it expects)
06. Writing 'puts' to see value of various Ruby classes like strings, arrays, hashes, etc

### List of resources that have been helpful
1. http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.3/
2. http://google.com
3. https://learn-co.slack.com
4. https://www.dotnetperls.com/#ruby

### Approach
Labs fall into two types in my mind that dictate how I'll approach them. The first is 'simple' and second is 'complex'. Simple labs usually just exercise and test the previous knowledge and skills that the were read in the past lesson gap between labs. The simple labs are useful because they are the building blocks for what future testing specs will possibly ask of students. Complex labs will test a more cumulative set of knowledge and skills and frequently appear at the tail end of whatever section you're working on. If it's simple I'll usually type relying on the 'methods' listed above will be the most helpful with a little reliance on the 'resources'. Complex ones will need the outside 'resources' more often and will require a more in depth understanding of the section or even previous sections lessons. In complex situations I've found that it's important to realize what Ruby classes are being worked with because that will dictate what methods are allowed to be used on your own variables/literals, which will inevitably require use of documentation from outside 'resources'.

I think my approach to the labs using the methods and resources listed above as well will prove helpful in the future. I'm sure the lessons and labs will only grow in difficulty and complexity and perhaps in the future my approach, methods and resources will grow or even change, but as far as the near future is concerned I believe this should be enough. Again I hope this might prove useful to anyone so that they can work through their own labs in a timely and effecient matter.
